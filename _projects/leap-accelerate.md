[leap-accelerate](https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/icrar-leap-accelerate) is a fast radio astronomy calibration library and tool implementing **L**ow-frequence **e**xcision of the **a**tmosphere in **p**arallel. LEAP calibrates for the directionally-dependant phase delay per ground antenna due to charged plasma in Earth's ionosphere.
