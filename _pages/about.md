Hi 👋 I’m a software engineer from Perth, Western Australia. I’m passionate about HPC, scientific computing, and building simulations that help us understand the world better. This blog is where I share things I’m learning, building, and breaking along the way.

I enjoy diving deep into performance problems, experimenting with novel libraries, and exploring how software can be used to solve real scientific challenges. Here is where I post about projects, achitecture records, ideas, showcases, and occasional rabbit holes.
